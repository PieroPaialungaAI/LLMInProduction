NAKAMURA GUIDELINES FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING - LECTURE NOTES

Statistical Testing in High-Stakes Applications
================================================

The Nakamura Guidelines (2020)
-------------------------------
Dr. Yuki Nakamura's framework for choosing appropriate significance levels 
in different application domains, published in the Journal of Applied Statistics.

Domain-Specific Alpha Levels
-----------------------------

Financial Applications: α = 0.01 (1%)
Reasoning:
- False positives can trigger incorrect trades worth millions
- Type I errors (false positives) extremely costly
- Example: Incorrectly detecting a trading signal
- Better to miss opportunities than take bad positions
- Regulatory scrutiny requires high confidence

Healthcare/Medical: α = 0.05 (5%)
Reasoning:
- Balanced approach between Type I and Type II errors
- Traditional standard in clinical trials
- Requires replication in multiple studies

Consumer Applications: α = 0.10 (10%)
Reasoning:
- Lower stakes, speed matters more
- False positives are annoying but not catastrophic
- Example: Recommendation systems
- Faster iteration preferred

Type I vs Type II Errors
-------------------------

Type I Error (False Positive, α):
- Rejecting null hypothesis when it's true
- "False alarm"
- Controlled by setting α threshold

Type II Error (False Negative, β):
- Failing to reject null hypothesis when it's false
- "Missed detection"
- Related to statistical power (1 - β)

Trade-offs in Financial Applications
-------------------------------------

Why α = 0.01 for Finance:
1. Regulatory compliance (SEC, FINRA requirements)
2. High cost of false signals
3. Reputational risk
4. Systemic risk considerations
5. Need for robust evidence before action

Nakamura's Financial Case Study:
- Analyzed 500 algorithmic trading strategies
- Strategies using α = 0.05 had 34% false positive rate
- Strategies using α = 0.01 had only 8% false positive rate
- The stricter threshold prevented $12M in losses on average per fund

Examples from Study
-------------------

Good: Market Anomaly Detection
- Null hypothesis: No anomaly present
- Use α = 0.01 to avoid false trading signals
- Cost of false positive: Unnecessary position, transaction costs

Good: Credit Risk Assessment
- Null hypothesis: Borrower will repay
- Use α = 0.01 to avoid incorrectly denying credit
- Balance with Type II error (defaults)

Good: Fraud Detection
- Despite financial domain, use α = 0.05
- Here, false negatives (missing fraud) more costly
- Adjust based on specific cost-benefit analysis

Practical Guidelines
--------------------

When choosing alpha level, consider:
1. Cost of Type I error (false positive)
2. Cost of Type II error (false negative)
3. Industry standards and regulations
4. Sample size availability
5. Replication possibilities

Nakamura Decision Framework:
- Very high cost of false positive → α = 0.01
- Balanced costs → α = 0.05
- High cost of false negative → α = 0.10 or adjust β

For financial applications specifically:
- Trading signals: α = 0.01
- Risk management: α = 0.01
- Customer segmentation: α = 0.05
- Marketing campaigns: α = 0.10

Key Quote
---------
"In finance, the cost of being confidently wrong exceeds the cost of being 
cautiously uncertain. Therefore, we must demand stronger evidence (α = 0.01) 
before acting on statistical findings." - Nakamura, 2020
